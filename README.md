AirBnB CLONE:
The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
THE CONSOLE:
The AirBnB console project is about:
	-creating your data model
	-managing (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
	-storing and persisting objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system.
This storage engine gives an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”.
This means: from the console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI built later, one won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how the objects are stored.
The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine.

COMMAND-LINE INTERPRETER:
A command interpreter is a program that allows you to enter commands and execute them on your computer. It can be used for various purposes, such as automating tasks, accessing system functions, or running scripts. There are different types of command interpreters, depending on the operating system and the programming language they support.

To start a command interpreter, you need to open a terminal or a console window on your computer. This is a program that provides an interface for interacting with the command interpreter. Depending on your operating system and preferences, you may have different options for opening a terminal or a console window. For example, on Windows, you can use the PowerShell or the Command Prompt programs1. On Mac OS, you can use the Terminal app2. On Linux, you can use the Terminal emulator or any other terminal program available in your distribution3.

To use a command interpreter, you need to type commands in the terminal or console window and press Enter. The command interpreter will then process your commands and display the results on the screen. Some commands may require additional options or arguments to work properly. You can also use special characters like $ , & , * , etc. to perform various operations in some command interpreters4.

Some examples of common commands that you can use in different command interpreters are:

ls: This command lists the files and directories in the current working directory.
cd: This command changes the current working directory to another one.
pwd: This command prints the current working directory.
cp: This command copies files or directories from one location to another.
mv: This command moves or renames files or directories.
rm: This command removes files or directories.
cat: This command displays the contents of a file or concatenates multiple files.
echo: This command prints a message or a variable value to the standard output.
grep: This command searches for a pattern in a file or input and prints matching lines.
find: This command searches for files or directories that match certain criteria and performs actions on them.
ps: This command displays information about the processes running on your computer.
kill: This command sends signals to processes to terminate them.
